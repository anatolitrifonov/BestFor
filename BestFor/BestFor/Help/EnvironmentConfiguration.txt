The only real place where we need dependency on environment is data context.
Dirty solution is to use connection string depending on computer name.

So far I do not see any use of configuration or environment variables to help us with by computer settings without checking in a file.
Having a configuration per developer is not a very good idea.

This does not help either since if we change this we will stop seing detailed error crash page
"environmentVariables": {
    "Hosting:Environment": "Development"
}
