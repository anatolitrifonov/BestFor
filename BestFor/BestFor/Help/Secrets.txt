Secrets.

All app settings that can not go to source code are in the local file appsettings.secret.json.
It is not in source control.
But there is a file appsettings.secret.sample.json that shows which values are needed.

Search code for appsettings.secret.json to see where it is loaded.

Connection Strings.
Connection strings are loaded from appsettings.json based on computer name loaded from
System.Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("COMPUTERNAME");
Or it gets overwritten by environment variable 
System.Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("main_database_connection");
This needs to set on azure itself.
