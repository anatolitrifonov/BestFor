Api controllers expect the callers to pass the special header in each call.
All api controllers inherit from BaseApiController
Each call that needs to be protected must call "if (!ParseAntiForgeryHeader())" from BaseApiController.
If false is returned controller deals with error.
Look at the pages that call api controllers for header/token generation.
