<system.serviceModel>
This configuration section contains all the Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) ServiceModel configuration elements.

	<extensions>
	This configuration section contains a collection of extensions, which enable the user to create user-defined bindings, behaviors, and other aspects of extensions.

		<behaviorExtensions>
		Behavior extensions enable the user to create user-defined behavior elements.
		These elements can be used alongside the standard Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) behavior elements.
		The behaviorExtensions section defines the element such that it can be used in configuration. Here is an example of a typical behavior extension.

	</extensions>

	<behaviors>
	This element defines two child collections named endpointBehaviors and serviceBehaviors. 
	Each collection defines behavior elements consumed by endpoints and services respectively. 
	Each behavior element is identified by its unique name attribute. Starting with .NET Framework 4, 
	bindings and behaviors are not required to have a name. For more information about default configuration and nameless bindings and behaviors, 
	see Simplified Configuration and Simplified Configuration for WCF Services.
